# Hydrodynamics of Insect like Water Surface Locomotion
 Repository for the Experimental Rig of IP: Design of an experimental set-up for research into the hydrodynamics of insect-like water surface locomotion

Individual Project Author:             James Maybey   (jdm1g20@soton.ac.uk)
PIC for Assembly of Experimental Rig:  Kai            (kwl1y19@soton.ac.uk)
Supervisor:                            Swathi Krishna (s.b.krishna@soton.ac.uk)

Current status:
 - Experimental rig nearing completion

Future work:
 1. Find better approach to achieve sinusoidal motion
 2. Fabricate additional 'platform' to ensure outer rod is straight
 3. Swap flexible couplers for solid couplers
